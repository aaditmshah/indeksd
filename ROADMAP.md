## Planned Features

- **Key Ranges** Support typed IDBKeyRanges

- **Table Subscriptions** Support to subscribe to changes to a given table. Could be used to support a React hook for rendering content added to the table (for example).

- **Cursor Support**

- **Advanced Search** Support applying more complex predicates to table searches.

- **Sorting** Currently searching on an index will naturally sort by that index... Allow sorting by arbitrary fields.
